<span id="index-2"></span><h1>Object types<a class="headerlink" href="#object-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Ipe supports five different types of objects that can be placed on a
page, namely path objects (which includes all objects with a stroked
contour and filled interior, such as (poly)lines, polygons, splines,
splinegons, circles and ellipses, circular and elliptic arcs, and
rectangles), text objects, image objects, group objects, and reference
objects (which means that a symbol is used at a certain spot on the
page).</p>
<p>Path and text objects are created by clicking the left mouse button
somewhere on the canvas using the correct Ipe mode.  Group objects are
created using the <em>Group</em> function in the <em>Edit</em> menu.
Image objects are added to the document using <em>Insert image</em> in
the <em>File</em> menu. Reference objects can be created either using
mark mode, or using the <em>Symbols</em> ipelet.</p>
<span class="target" id="path-objects"></span><div class="section" id="index-3">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Path objects<a class="headerlink" href="#index-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Path objects are defined by a set of <em>subpaths</em>, that is, curves
in the plane.  Each subpath is either open or closed, and consists of
straight line segments, circular or elliptic arc segments, parabola
segments (or, equivalently, quadratic Bézier splines), cubic Bézier
splines, and cubic B-spline segments.  The curves are drawn with the
stroke color, dash style, and line width; the interior of the object
specified is filled using the fill color.</p>
<p>The distinction between open and closed subpaths is meaningful for
stroking only, for filling any open subpath is implicitely closed.
Stroking a set of subpaths is identical to stroking them individually.
This is not true for filling: using several subpaths, one can
construct objects with holes, and more complicated pattern.  The
filling algorithm is normally the <em>even-odd rule</em> of
Postscript/PDF: To determine whether a point lies inside the filled
shape, draw a ray from that point in any direction, and count the
number of path segments that cross the ray.  If this number is odd,
the point is inside; if even, the point is outside.</p>
<p>Ipe can draw arrows on the first and last segment of a path object,
but only if that segment is part of an open subpath.</p>
<p>There are several Ipe modes that create path objects in different
ways.  All modes create an object consisting of a single subpath only.
To make more complicated path objects, such as objects with holes, you
create each boundary component separately, then select them all and
use the <em>Compose paths</em> function in the <em>Edit</em> menu.  The
reverse operation is <em>Decompose path</em>, you find it in the context
menu of a path object that has several subpaths.</p>
<p>You can also create complicated paths by joining curves sequentially.
For this to work, the endpoint of one path must be (nearly) identical
to the begin point of the next—easy to achieve using snapping.  You
select the path objects you wish to join, and call <em>Join paths</em>
in the <em>Edit</em> menu.  You can also join several open path objects
into a single closed path this way.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-4"></span><span class="target" id="index-5"></span><p id="index-6">Circles can be entered in three different ways.  To create an ellipse,
create a circle and shear or stretch and rotate it.  Circular arcs can
be entered by clicking three points on the arc or by clicking the
center of the supporting circle as well as the begin and end vertex of
the arc. They can be filled in Postscript/PDF fashion, and can have
arrows. You can stretch a circular arc to create an elliptic arc.</p>
<p>A common application for arcs is to mark angles in drawings. The snap
keys are useful to create such arcs: set arc creation to <em>center &amp; 2
pts</em>, select <em>snap to vertex</em> and <em>snap to boundary</em>, click first on
the center point of the angle (which is magnetic) and click then on
the two bounding lines.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-7"></span><span class="target" id="index-8"></span><span class="target" id="index-9"></span><span class="target" id="index-10"></span><span class="target" id="index-11"></span><span class="target" id="index-12"></span><span class="target" id="index-13"></span><span class="target" id="index-14"></span><span class="target" id="index-15"></span><p id="index-16">There are two modes for creating more complex general path objects.
The difference between <em>line</em> mode and <em>polygon</em> mode is
that the first creates an open path, the latter generates a closed
one.  As a consequence, the <em>line</em> mode uses the current arrow
settings, while the <em>polygon</em> mode doesn’t.</p>
<p>The path object created using line or polygon mode consists of
segments of various types.  The initial setting is to create straight
segments. By holding the shift-key when pressing the left mouse button
one can switch to splines.  Ipe offers three different kinds of
splines: uniform B-splines, cardinal splines, and clothoid splines.
You can select the type of spline in the <em>Properties</em> menu.
Quadratic and cubic Bézier spline segments can be created as special
cases of uniform B-splines with three and four control points.</p>
<p>Circular arcs can be added as follows: Click twice in polyline mode,
once on the starting point of the arc, then on a point in the correct
tangent direction.  Press the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">a</kbd> key, and click on the endpoint
of the arc.</p>
<p>To make curves where segments of different type are joined with
identical tangents, you can press the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">y</kbd> key whenever you are
starting a new segment: this will set the coordinate system centered
at the starting point of the segment, and aligned with the tangent to
the previous segment.</p>
<p>For the mathematically inclined, a more precise description of the
segments that can appear on a subpath follows.</p>
<p>A subpath consists of a sequence of segments.  Each segment is either
a straight line segment, an elliptic arc, or a spline of one of the
three supported types.</p>
<p>Note that a uniform B-spline with only three control points will be
drawn as a <em>quadratic</em> Bézier spline.  A B-spline with four
control points is by definition a cubic Bézier spline.</p>
<p>The quadratic Bézier spline defined by control points <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{0}\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{1}\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{2}\)</span>, is the curve</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(t) = (1-t)^{2} p_{0} + 2t(1-t) p_{1} + t^{2} p_{2}\)</span>,</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> ranges from 0 to 1. This implies that it starts in
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{0}\)</span> tangent to the line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{0}p_{1}\)</span>, ends in
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{2}\)</span> tangent to the line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{1}p_{2}\)</span>, and is contained
in the convex hull of the three points.  Any segment of any parabola
can be expressed as a quadratic Bézier spline.</p>
<p>For instance, the piece of the unit parabola <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y = x^{2}\)</span> between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=a\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=b\)</span> can be created with the control points</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{0} = (a, a^{2})\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{1} = (\frac{a + b}{2}, ab)\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{2} = (b, b^{2})\)</span></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Any piece of any parabola can be created by applying some affine
transformation to these points.</p>
<p>The cubic Bézier spline with control points <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{0}\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{2}\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{3}\)</span>, is the curve</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(t) = (1-t)^{3}p_{0} + 3t(1-t)^{2} p_{1} + 3 t^{2}(1-t) p_{2} + t^{3} p_{3}\)</span>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It starts in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{0}\)</span> being tangent to the line
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{0}p_{1}\)</span>, ends in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{3}\)</span> being tangent to the line
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{2}p_{3}\)</span>, and lies in the convex hull of the four control
points.</p>
<p>Uniform cubic B-splines approximate a series of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> control
points <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{0}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{1}\)</span>, …, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{n-1}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n
\geq 3\)</span>, with a curve consisting of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n-3\)</span> cubic Bézier
splines, see, for instance, Sederberg <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id3" id="id2">1</a>. To clamp the spline to
the first and last control point, the first and last knot are repeated
three times.  If the curve is closed (a <em>splinegon</em>), there is no
clamping and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> control points define <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> Bézier
splines.</p>
<p>Since each point on a Bézier curve is a convex combination of the
four control points, the curve segment lies in the convex hull of the
control points. Furthermore, any affine transformation can be applied
to the curve by applying it to the control points.  Note that a
control point has influence on only a few Bézier segments, so when
you edit a spline object and move a control point, only a short piece
of the spline in the neighborhood of the control point will move.</p>
<p>A <em>cardinal spline</em> is an <em>interpolating spline</em>—unlike a uniform
B-spline, it will go <em>through</em> the control points.  Ipe converts a
sequence of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> control points into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n-1\)</span> Bézier
segments, each starting and ending at a control point.  The tangent at
each control point is parallel to the segment connecting the previous
and the next control point.</p>
<p>Finally, a <em>clothoid spline</em> (spline type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spiro</span></code>) is created by
solving an optimization problem that tries to minimize the change in
curvature (so they look much “rounder” and are generally more
pleasing).  Details can be found in <a class="reference external" href="http://levien.com">Raph Levien’s thesis</a>.</p>
<p id="index-17">Existing polygonal objects can be edited, using Ipe’s <em>edit mode</em>. You
select the object you want to modify, and then press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">M-e</kbd> (or
select <span class="menuselection">Edit ‣ Edit object</span>). The object will be
placed in edit mode.</p>

<span id="id4"></span><h2>Text objects<a class="headerlink" href="#index-22" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Text objects come in two flavors: simple <em>labels</em>, and <em>minipages</em>.
There are two variants of these: <em>titles</em> (a label that serves as the
title of the page), and <em>textbox</em> (a minipage that spans the entire
width of the page).</p>
<p>The position you have to click to start creating a <em>label</em> object is
normally the leftmost baseline point (but this can be changed by
changing the object’s horizontal and vertical alignment).  A popup
window appears where you can enter Latex source code.</p>
<p>A <em>minipage</em> object is different from a simple text object in
that its width is part of its definition. When you create a minipage
object, you first have to drag out a horizontal segment for the
minipage.  This is used as the top edge of the minipage—it will
extend downwards as far as necessary to accomodate all the text.
Minipages are formatted using, not surprisingly, Latex’s
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minipage</span></code> environment.  Latex tries to fill the given bounding
box as nicely as possible. It is possible to include center
environments, lemmas, and much more in minipages.</p>
<p>To create a <em>textbox</em> object, simply press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">F10</kbd>.  Ipe
automatically places the object so that it spans the entire width of
the page (the <em>layout</em> settings in the stylesheet determine how much
space is left on the sides), and places it vertically underneath the
textboxes already on the page.  This is particularly convenient for
creating presentations with a lot of text, or with items that appear
<a class="reference internal" href="70_presentations.html#views"><span class="std std-ref">one by one</span></a>.</p>
<p><em>Title</em> objects are managed by Ipe automatically.  They are
special labels that are created using <em>Edit title &amp; sections</em> in
the <em>Page</em> menu.  Their color, size, alignment, and position on
the page is determined by the stylesheet.</p>
<p>You can use any LaTeX-command that is legal inside a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\makebox</span></code> (for
labels) or inside a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minipage</span></code> (for minipages).  You cannot use
certain commands that involve a non-linear translation into PDF.  In
particular, you cannot use commands to generate hyperlinks (the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\href</span></code> command from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hyperref</span></code> package will not work).  If
you need to add links to your Ipe document, you will need to use a
<a class="reference internal" href="#group-objects"><span class="std std-ref">group object</span></a>.</p>
<p>You can use color in your text objects, using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\textcolor</span></code>
command, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-latex notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>This is in black. <span class="k">\textcolor</span><span class="nb">{</span>red<span class="nb">}{</span>This is in red.<span class="nb">}</span> This is in black.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All the symbolic colors of your current stylesheet are also available
as arguments to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\textcolor</span></code>.  You can also use absolute colors,
for instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-latex notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>This is in black. <span class="k">\textcolor</span><span class="na">[rgb]</span><span class="nb">{</span>1,1,0<span class="nb">}{</span>This is in yellow.<span class="nb">}</span> This is in black.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p id="index-23">If you need LaTeX-commands that are defined in additional LaTeX
packages, you can include (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\usepackage</span></code>) those in the LaTeX
preamble, which can be set in <em>Document properties</em> in the <em>Edit</em>
menu.</p>
<p>Note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xcolor</span></code>-package is loaded automatically by Ipe,
without any options.  If you need to use package options of the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xcolor</span></code>-package, place the command</p>
<div class="highlight-latex notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">\ipedefinecolors</span><span class="nb">{</span>options<span class="nb">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>in your preamble. It has to go before the first use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xcolor</span></code>
commands in your document.</p>
<p>After you have created or edited a text object, the Ipe screen display
will show the beginning of the Latex source.  You can select <em>Run
Latex</em> from the <em>File</em> menu to create the PDF representation of the
object.  This converts all the text objects in your document at once,
and Ipe will display a correct rendition of the text afterwards.</p>
<p>Most Ipe users turn on <em>Automatically run Latex</em> in the <em>File</em> menu.
If this is activated, Ipe will run Latex in <em>most</em>
situations where a text object or a style has changed and the text
representation needs to be updated.  There are some exceptions, for
instance undo and redo—just press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl-L</kbd> to run Latex
manually.</p>
<p>If the Latex conversion process results in errors, Ipe will
automatically show you the log file created by the Latex run.  If you
cannot figure out the problem, look in <a class="reference internal" href="80_advanced.html#troubleshooting"><span class="std std-ref">the section on
troubleshooting</span></a>.</p>
<p>You can use Unicode text, such as accented characters, Greek,
Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, in your text objects, once
<a class="reference internal" href="66_babel.html"><span class="doc">you have set up the necessary style files and fonts</span></a>.</p>
<p>When Ipe computes the bounding box for a piece of text, it relies
entirely on the dimensions that Latex provides.  Sometimes glyphs are
larger than their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">official</span></code> dimensions, and as a result this
bounding box is too tight.  In the following figure, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">G</span></code>
stick out of the golden rectangle (the bounding box computed by Ipe
based on the Latex dimensions) at the top, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> sticks out at the
bottom:</p>
<img alt="_images/fontbbox.svg" class="align-center" src="_images/fontbbox.svg" /><p>When you experience that text in your figures is clipped, you may have
to enlarge the figure’s bounding box using a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BBOX</span></code> layer.</p>
<p>The opposite problem can occur when you use transformed text.  Ipe
computes the bounding box for the transformed text by transforming the
bounding box for the original text, and the result can be too large:</p>
<img alt="_images/fontbbox2.svg" class="align-center" src="_images/fontbbox2.svg" /><p>If this is a problem, you can put the text object inside a group and
set a clipping path for the group.</p>
<span class="target" id="images"></span></div>
<div class="section" id="image-objects">
<span id="index-24"></span><h2>Image objects<a class="headerlink" href="#image-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Images are inserted using <em>Insert image</em> (in the <em>File</em> menu).  Once
in a drawing, you can scale, stretch, shear, and rotate an image.  You
can read in some scanned drawing and draw on top of it within
Ipe. This is useful if you have a drawing on paper and want to make an
Ipe version of it.</p>
<p><em>Insert image</em> can handle images in JPEG and PNG format (and
possibly others such as GIF, BMP, TIFF, depending on the operating
system).  JPEG images are stored as is (PDF supports the JPEG
standard), all other images are stored as a (compressed) bitmap, with
full-color resolution (24 bits per pixel).</p>
<p>It is also possible to simply paste an image into Ipe (this should not
be used for JPEG images, as you would then store the bitmap without
JPEG compression).</p>
<p>Images are stored efficiently in PDF format.  It is reasonable to
create PDF presentations with lots of JPEG photographs in Ipe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="group-objects">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>Group objects<a class="headerlink" href="#group-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Group objects are created by selecting any number of objects and using
the <em>Group</em> function from the <em>Edit</em> menu.  The grouped
objects then behave like a single object.  To modify a group object,
it has to be decomposed into its parts using <em>Ungroup</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="clipping">
<h3>Clipping<a class="headerlink" href="#clipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can set a <em>clipping path</em> for a group.  The group will then be
clipped to this path—nothing will be drawn outside the clipping
path.  This is useful, for instance, to clip out an interesting part
of an existing drawing or bitmap.</p>
<p>To add a clipping path, select a group as the primary selection, and a
path object as the secondary selection.  Then select <em>Add clipping
path</em> from the group’s context menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="decorations">
<h3>Decorations<a class="headerlink" href="#decorations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Group objects can be <em>decorated</em>.  A decoration consists of one
or more path objects that are drawn around the group.  The decoration
is automatically resized to fit the bounding box of the group.</p>
<p>To use decorations, you first need to add a <a class="reference internal" href="60_stylesheets.html"><span class="doc">stylesheet</span></a> to your document that defines decoration
symbols—you may want to start with the provided style sheet
<em>decorations.isy</em>.  Then use the group’s object menu to choose a
decoration for the group.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editing-text-in-group">
<h3>Editing text in group<a class="headerlink" href="#editing-text-in-group" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Groups often contain some text.  For instance, a graph vertex is
nicely represented as a group consisting of a text label and either a
mark symbol such as a disk, or a path object (a circle, rectangle, or
a more complicated shape).  When drawing a graph, one can place the
vertices by copying and pasting these vertex objects, but then one
needs to set the text label in each vertex.</p>
<p>To make this easy, the <em>Edit object</em> operation (which is
otherwise used to edit the text in text objects and the shape of path
objects) can also be used for group objects that contain at lease one
text object.  It allows you to update the text inside the
<em>top-most</em> text object of the group.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="recursive-group-edit">
<h3>Recursive group edit<a class="headerlink" href="#recursive-group-edit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Often you want to modify the contents of a group without disturbing
the rest of your drawing.  To make this easy, Ipe provides the
<em>Edit group</em> operation, available either from the <em>Edit</em>
menu or from the group’s context menu.</p>
<p>Group editing is implemented by un-grouping the group into a newly
created layer whose name will start with <em>EDIT-GROUP</em>.  Ipe locks
all other layers, so that you can concentrate on editing the objects
in the group.  When you are done, you select <em>End group edit</em>
from the <em>Edit</em> menu.  Ipe will take all the objects in the group
edit layer, group them together, and place the group back in its
original layer.</p>
<p>You can edit groups recursively: If your group contains another group
that you want to modify, you can perform another group edit operation.
Each <em>End group edit</em> closes one group edit layer, until you
return to your normal drawing workflow.</p>
<p>Group edit is not a special mode—all the state needed by Ipe to
manage editing the group is stored inside the drawing.  This means
that you can save your drawing during a group edit (also, auto-saving
works during a group edit).  If you have a document with multiple
pages, you can also start group edits on several pages in parallel,
for instance to copy and paste objects between groups.</p>
<p>It is legal to unlock the other layers of the page so that you can
move objects into and out of the group.  You should, however, be
careful with changing anything about the layers of the page—do not
re-order or rename the layers.  If you need new layers, create them at
the end of the layer list.</p>
<p>When you perform the <em>End group edit</em> operation, the group edit
layer must be the active layer.  If you changed the active layer, you
will have to change it back to be able to return from the group edit.</p>
<p>Note that group edit does not currently preserve a clipping path set
on the group.  It does preserve the group’s decoration and link
destination.</p>

<h3>Links to websites, videos, and other pages<a class="headerlink" href="#links-to-websites-videos-and-other-pages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Group objects allow you to create <em>active links</em>: when the PDF
document is viewed in a PDF viewer, one can click inside the bounding
box of the group to cause some action.</p>
<p>You add a link to a group by bringing up the object menu, and using
<em>Set link URL</em>.  Note that only top-level group objects on a page
(that is, a group object that is not inside another group) are turned
into active links.</p>
<p>Ipe supports several types of link actions:</p>
<p><em>Websites</em></p>
<p>If you provide a URL such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://ipe.otfried.org</span></code> as a link
action, then clicking on the link will open the webpage in a web
browers.</p>
<p><em>Launching media</em></p>
<p>If the link action starts with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">launch:</span></code>, then the action starts a
program to view the given file.  For instance, the link action
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">launch:apollo17.avi</span></code> would start a video player playing the file
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apollo17.avi</span></code> in the directory that also contains the PDF file.</p>
<p>The PDF presentations apps <a class="reference external" href="http://iihm.imag.fr/blanch/software/osx-presentation/">Presentation</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://pdfpc.github.io/">pdfpc</a> understand these links, and play the
video inside the presentation app.  Pdfpc will even embed the video
into the current slide, using the bounding box of the group object to
place the video.</p>
<p>Pdfpc allows you to provide a few more parameters: for instance, the
link action</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>launch:apollo17.avi?autostart&amp;loop&amp;start=5&amp;stop=12
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>will start the movie as soon as the slide is viewed, plays the movie
in a loop, starting at 5 seconds and ending at 12 seconds into the
movie.</p>
<p>You can also launch other types of documents.  For instance, clicking
on a group object with link action <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">launch:summary.txt</span></code> will open
the text file <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">summary.txt</span></code> in a text editor.</p>
<p><em>Navigating inside the document</em></p>
<p>If the link action starts with <em>goto:</em>, then clicking on the
group object will navigate to another page of the same PDF document.
You identify pages using their <em>section name</em>.  So if you have a
page with section name <em>chapter3</em> in your document, then the link
action <em>goto:chapter3</em> will jump to that page.</p>
<p><em>Standard actions</em></p>
<p>PDF currently defines four standard actions: <em>NextPage</em>,
<em>PrevPage</em>, <em>FirstPage</em>, and <em>LastPage</em>.  You use these
by prefixing them with <em>named:</em>.  For example, the link action
<em>named:PrevPage</em> creates an action to go to the previous page.
This can be used, for instance, to place buttons in a background layer
that appears on every page of a document.</p>

<div class="section" id="reference-objects-and-symbols">
<span id="reference-objects"></span><h2>Reference objects and symbols<a class="headerlink" href="#reference-objects-and-symbols" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A symbol is a single Ipe object (which can of course be a group) that
is defined in a document’s stylesheet.  A reference object is a
reference to a symbol, placed at a given position on the page.</p>
<p>Symbols can be parameterized with stroke and fill color, pen width,
and symbol size.  Whether or not a symbol accepts which parameter is
visible from the symbol’s name: if it takes any parameter, the name
must end in a pair of parentheses containing some of the letters
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> (in this order), for the parameters stroke,
fill, pen, and size.  References to parameterized symbols allow all
the attributes that the symbol accepts.</p>
<p>All references can be translated around the page. Whether or not the
symbol can be rotated or stretched depends on the definition of the
symbol in the stylesheet.</p>
<p>If a symbol named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Background</span></code> exists in your stylesheet, it is
automatically displayed on each page, at the very back.  To suppress
the automatic display, create a layer named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BACKGROUND</span></code> on the
page. (If such a layer is present, it suppresses the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Background</span></code>
symbol.  It does not matter if the layer itself is visible or not.)</p>
<p id="index-25">Marks are symbols with special support from the Ipe user interface.
They are used to mark points in the drawing, and come in several
different looks (little circles, discs, squares, boxes, or crosses).
You can define your own mark shapes by defining appropriate symbols in
your stylesheet.</p>
<p>Note that marks behave quite different from path objects. In
particular, you should not confuse a disc mark with a little disc
created as a circle object:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a solid mark (type <em>disk</em> and <em>square</em>) only obeys the
stroke color (but <em>fdisk</em> and <em>fsquare</em> marks are filled
with the fill color);</p></li>
<li><p>when you scale a mark, it will not change its size (you can change
the mark size from the properties panel, though);</p></li>
<li><p>when you rotate a mark, it does not change its orientation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can change a mark’s shape and size later.</p>
