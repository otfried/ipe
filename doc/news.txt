Ipe 7.2.19 (2020-06-14)

 * Improve pasting bitmaps on Windows and Qt: you can now paste images
   directly from the file browser, with the additional benefit that
   jpeg files are now treated as jpeg images.  This also works from
   the Photos app in Windows 10 and e.g. in "xviewer" (#328).

 * Fix text object colour not updating when it is changed from the
   selector (bug #333, this was broken by 7.2.15).

   IpePresenter on Windows (#4).

 * User interface no longer freezes during Latex compilation.

 * Pasting images now preserves transparency on MacOS (thanks Csaba!).

 * Pasting images on Windows will now preserve transparency when the
   producer supports PNG on the clipboard (as seems to be common -
   the Windows clipboard appears to be a big mess).

 * Make sure ipelets can no longer return a page with only secondary
   selections (bug #315).

 * Fix attribute being uninitialized if not set from Lua.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

   There are many variants of interpolating splines, Ipe now provides
   cardinal splines and clothoid splines (through libspiro) (#140).

 * Ipe's PDF parser can now read PDF files where stream lengths are
   indirect references (#120).

   'ipeextract' to read such files.

 * Ipe File format 70215 to support interpolating splines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.2.14 (2019-04-19)

   #242).

 * Fix "Waiting for external editor" dialog not closing on MacOS. Define
   default external editors for Windows and MacOS.

 * New ipelet to select objects by type and/or by attribute value.
 
 * Can now use ".ipe/ipe.conf" to define environment variables on
   Linux and OSX.

 * The link action string of group objects is now more powerful.  You
   can use it to create links inside the Ipe document (so that
   clicking on an object in the PDF file will take you to a different
   page), and to launch videos or audio (which can be played inside
   some PDF viewers).

 * Tiling patterns now follow opacity of the object (feature #195).

 * The bullet in items now has the text color (bug #161).

 * The coordinate system (the axes) can now be toggled on and off
   without having to reset the origin.
 
 * When exporting using ipetoipe, page notes are not included as PDF
   annotations (but see -keepnotes) (feature #215).

 * Storing section names of pages as PDF "named destinations", so that
   external links can point to a specific page of an Ipe document.

 * Fixed low-resolution display on Retina displays on OSX (bug #226).
   The problem seems to be caused by the upgrade of Cairo to 1.16.0, 
   it is currently fixed by using a Cairo surface as a backing store
   instead of a CGLayer.

 * Use page-piece dictionary to store Ipe XML data inside PDF file.

 * Pressing "Ok" after "Apply" in text edit dialog no longer causes a
   Latex run (feature #144).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.2.10 (2019-02-04)

 * IpePresenter companion program on Windows and Linux, to show PDF
   presentations (made with Ipe or beamer). The presenter's display
   shows the current slide, the next slide, the slide notes, and a
   running clock.  The audience sees only the current slide.
   IpePresenter relies entirely on the PDF file, so no Latex is needed
   for a presentation.
 
 * Move to modern C++: use nullptr consistently, compile with C++17,
   starting to use unique_ptr and shared_ptr.

 * Page notes are saved as PDF annotations (feature #187).

 * Fixed strange conversion of labels to math mode (bug #211).

 * Implemented undo/redo both in Ipe and in dialog text fields on OSX
   (bug #212).

 * Can now change direction of horizontal scrolling (with Alt+Scroll
   wheel) using prefs.scroll.direction.x.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

   on all platforms (feature #206).

 * Fix unmarked pages appearing in bookmarks after exporting with
   -markedview (bug #205).

 * Can use config.ipedrive to refer to the drive that Ipe is on in
   customization files.  Environment variables can use "ipe:" to refer
   to the same drive (feature #203). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.2.8 (2019-01-10)

 * Windows binaries now built for 64-bit Windows.

   -pdf and -svg options work for iperender.
 
 * Zoom with two-finger pinch gestures on the touchpad/trackpad
   implemented on OSX and Windows.

 * Two-finger moves on the touchpad/trackpad and the scroll wheel now
   pan the canvas rather than zoom (feature #158).  To go back to the
   zooming behaviour, set prefs.scroll.pan to false.

 * Number of objects in each layer shown next to the layer name.

 * The page specifications in ipetoipe and iperender can now be given
   using page names (feature #136).

   (bug #159).

 * Fixed unmarking of views and pages on Windows (bug #155).

 * Fixed crash when displaying grayscale JPEG on Windows.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.2.7 (2016-12-09) Bayreuth edition

 * On Windows 10, Monitor DPI is used automatically (but does not yet
   change when the Window is moved to a different monitor).
 
 * Fixed styles directory in ipescript in bundle mode (OSX, snap,
   appimage).

 * Fixed vertex-move mode when edges have been transformed before.

 * On OSX, shear mode and graph mode toolbar buttons were not
   selectable.

   ~/.ipe/scripts to the default list in appimage and Ipe.app.

 * Refuse to load style sheets with fractional grid sizes (bug #115).

 * Refuse precise scale/stretch with factor zero (bug #114).

 * Use compatibility layer on Luatex 0.85 (bug #113).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.2.6 (2016-09-19) Bayreuth edition

 * A file format update was necessary.  Ipe versions older than 7.2.6
   will not be able to read documents create with 7.2.6 and newer.

 * Added new mode to move graph vertices.  While the vertex moves, its
   incident edges follow automatically.  This uses a simple heuristic:
   Vertices are groups, references, or text objects, edges are path
   objects with a single open curve.

 * Text objects of type label can now also have a style.  Math objects
   are now handled as having style "math", other styles are useful for
   styling graph nodes using Tikz, etc.  Look at the new style file
   'tikz.isy' for inspiration how this can be used.

 * Added style file 'note-paper.isy' with a note paper background
   (like the xournal background), for taking handwritten notes._{}

 * Revived exporting to pdf when saving in xml format (set
   prefs.auto_export_to_pdf).

 * On Windows, touch is now only used for pan and zoom.

 * Tuned pen handling on Windows 8 and higher.  It now works smoothly
   on my slow Windows tablet.

 * Fixed handling of PDF resources from pdflatex to work with the
   output generated by Tikz.

 * Fixed layout of dialogs created without 'addButton' on OSX.

 * Try to work around Ubuntu bug (see #42) by unsetting environment
   variables QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME and UBUNTU_MENUPROXY when Ipe
   starts.

 * Fixed cut-off glyphs (bug #93).

 * Fixed error rendering TTF and TTC fonts (bug #97).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.2.5 (2016-07-19) Bayreuth edition

 * The PDF interpreter for text objects has been improved to handle a
   much larger subset of PDF.  Using interesting PDF-generating latex
   packages is now supported and encouraged, including tikz, pgf, and
   tcolorbox.  This makes it easy to create boxes for theorems and the
   like in presentations, as the beamer package does.

 * The use of \includegraphics inside text objects is now supported.
   Since PDF is a very complex standard, some PDF features will not be
   displayed correctly on the screen (but will work correctly in Ipe's
   PDF output).  A few features cannot even be supported in the PDF
   output. 

 * luatex is now supported as an alternative to pdftex and xetex.  

 * New shear transformation mode.  Without axis set, it will use a
   horizontal line as the fixed line, otherwise your x-axis.

 * Groups can now be decorated using "decoration symbols".  Those
   should be a path (or a group of paths), and are automatically
   resized to fit the bounding box of the group.  You'll need to
   include a style sheet containing decoration symbols
   (e.g. "decorations.isy" from the distribution), then right click on
   a group to set a decoration.
 
 * Action "Edit object" can now be used to edit text inside a group
   object.  This is convenient, for instance, to edit graph vertices
   (which are most easily represented as a group consisting of a
   circle and a text object, or a mark and a text object).

 * Experimental recursive group edit implemented.  It keeps all state
   inside the Ipe document, so that you can save in the middle of a
   group edit (and autosave continues to work during the group edit).
   Group edit creates a new layer "EDIT GROUP", unpacks the group into
   this layer, and locks all other layers. "End group edit"
   automatically groups the elements again and returns the group to
   its original layer.

 * New action "set tangent direction" to set the axis to be tangent to
   a given circle (or ellipse) or arc.  Move mouse close to boundary
   of circle or circular arc and press Ctrl+F3.

 * Improvements for ink mode to make it more responsive, less
   memory-consuming, and display smoother strokes (thanks to Zhengdao
   Wang and Philipp Kindermann for contributing code).

 * Fixed missing shortcut for box mode.

 * Added "Apply properties" to object menus. Fixed bug that caused it
   to be applied to all objects (not just the selected ones).

 * When creating a path object, the current arrow size and shape is
   set, so that they can be used if an arrow is enabled later.

 * Snapping no longer occurs for objects in layers that are not
   visible (bug #88).

 * Text objects now keep their PDF representation as a separate
   XObject.  This implies that after changing the color of a text
   object, Latex needs to be run to see the change on screen. This
   should be automatic when automatic Latex run is enabled.

 * \ipesymbol is no longer supported - you can use tikz or pgf
   instead, or simply \includegraphics.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.2.4 (2016-06-23) Bayreuth edition

 * New modes for making rectangles and parallelograms.

 * Page numbering works again (bug #57).  They are now customizable,
   see the manual.

   right-clicking on any top-level group object and using "Set link
   URL" (feature #41).

 * Actions to pick the properties of an object (and set them in the
   properties panel), and to apply all current properties to the
   selected objects.

 * Replaced NSComboBox by NSPopUpButton.  They are more comfortable to
   use (you can click anywhere to change the setting, rather than just
   on the arrow), can display the color icons, and allow to re-select the
   currently selected choice (bug #47).
   
 * File format has been updated to 70204, but only if one of the two
   new features is used (external links, non-default pagenumberstyle).

 * Implemented double-clicks on OSX (bug #79).

 * Some support for HiDPI screens in Windows and Qt (use
   prefs.ui_scale and prefs.toolbar_scale).

 * Fixed behaviour when prefs.terminate_on_close is false on OSX (bug
   #51).

 * Improved width of grid size/angle size selector (bug #48).

 * Updated ipe.dtd and manual for the correct Ipe file format (bug
   #67).

 * Customizable order of toolbars on Windows (feature #28).  

 * Fixed angle size menu on Qt.

 * Fixed join path for more than two segments (bug #85).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.2.2 (2016-01-24) Fabian's edition

 * Page/View selector implemented for Cocoa.

 * Page sorter implemented for Cocoa, with drag and drop of pages.

 * Fixed redrawing on Cocoa (bug #34).

 * Removed APIs post OS X 10.8 (bug #35).

 * Including qvoronoi ipelet in Ipe.app for OS X.

 * Ctrl-click instead of right click in line editing tools and for path

   using xetex.

 * Fixed problem with exporting to eps caused by wrappers in cmr10.pfb
   and other fonts that are incorrectly embedded by pdflatex.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.2.1 (2016-01-01)

 * Color of primary and secondary selection can be set in prefs.lua.

 * Ipe can now use xelatex instead of pdflatex.  You can choose your
   TeX engine in the document properties.

 * Type1C and CID-keyed fonts are supported.  This means that OpenType
   fonts on your system should work through xelatex.

 * Location of pdflatex or xelatex can be specified as an environment
   variable IPELATEXPATH.

 * On Windows, environment variables can be set by placing a text file
   with name "ipe.conf" in the Ipe folder. This makes it possible to
   provide Ipe on a USB-stick without modifying the host system at
   all. (The Ipe folder is the same place that contains the "bin",
   "icons", "lua" subdirectories.  Each line of "ipe.conf" is of the
   form "VARIABLE=setting".)

 * Snap indicator in status line and mode indicator in properties
   allow advanced users to hide all toolbars without losing any
   feedback. 

 * Using native user interface with Cocoa on OS X.

 * Continuous spell-checking in text input/edit dialogs on OS X
   (optional, set prefs.spell_check).

 * Multiple shortcuts are no longer allowed in "shortcuts.lua".

 * Added Header files to Mac OS app bundle.

 * Removed support for the "14 standard PDF fonts".  Their use is
   deprecated in PDF 1.5 - all fonts should now be embedded.  This
   means it's no longer necessary to create a fontmap during Ipe
   installation.

 * Removed support for codeset conversion.  Latex supports Unicode
   well now, in particular when you use xelatex.

 * Ipe now requires a C++11 compiler.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.1.10 (2015-11-21)

 * "Export to EPS" replaces saving in EPS format.  Ipe can still load
   Ipe figures in EPS format, but will not save in this format
   anymore.  Use "Export to EPS" if you need EPS figures for your
   publisher.

 * I learnt how to compile on Mac OS X, and now build "Ipe.app"
   binaries myself.  The makefiles and instructions for Mac OS are
   updated.

 * Ipe now compiles with both Qt 4 and Qt 5.  This is useful since Qt
   5 drops support for older Mac platforms (in particular Snow
   Leopard). 

 * Transparency now available by default.
   
 * Trying both .dylib and .so extension when loading compiled ipelets
   on Mac OS.

 * Ipelets compiled using -bundle and .so extension on Mac OS.

 * Removed lfs from Ipe, added Platform::listDirectory that works
   correctly with UTF-8 on Windows.

 * Ipe now runs correctly on Windows if installed in a directory with
   non-ASCII characters (feature #17).

 * On Windows, when closing from the cross icon in the window frame,
   the "Save" option now works.

 * Fixed problem with Enter key closing edit dialogs (bug #6).

 * Windows and Mac OS binaries using Lua 5.3.

 * On Windows libpng/libjpeg replaced by Windows GDI+ calls.
   "Insert image" now also supports BMP, GIF, and TIFF.

 * On Mac OS, libjpeg replaced by CoreGraphics calls.
 
 * "Export to PNG" added to user interface (feature #22).

 * Removed auto-exporting functionality.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.1.9 (2015-10-24)

 * Migrated to Qt5.

 * Windows binary now works on WinXP by dynamically loading
   GetGestureInfo (issue #9, thanks to czietz for the patch).

 * Ignore spurious double-click (bug #17).

 * Fixed Ctrl+F shortcut on Windows (bug #9).

 * Fixed updating of style sheets on Windows (bug #8).

 * Fixed crash when right-clicking on a toolbar icon on Windows (bug
   #7). 

 * Changed ordering of Ipelet directories (bug #16).

 * Fixed misleading caption on layer menu (bug #14).

 * Compiling with clang++-3.5 for testing.

 * Bitmaps read from files are now compressed during insertion, crash
   during insertion of PNG files with color palette fixed. Inserting
   PNG images with color-keyed transparent color works now (bugs #19,
   #20).

 * Improved "About ipelets" dialog.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.1.8 (2015-07-11)

 * (Partial) support for MacOS retina displays.  You need to set
   prefs.retina to true to enable this.  Thanks to Michael Thon for
   testing my experiments.

 * Fixed compilation of qvoronoi ipelet on Mac OS X (bug #31).

 * Now using standard libjpeg API for embedded JPEG images, rather
   than the TurboJPEG API.  Therefore Ipe now compiles with either
   JPEG library.  Thanks to Michael Thon for the patch (bug #32).

 * IPEBUNDLE variable to compile Ipe without references to the file
   system. 

 * IPENOGESTURE variable to compile Ipe for Windows Vista and older.

 * Fixed Document properties dialog (bug #33).

 * Fixed first entry in layer list popup menu.

 * Fixed crash in Voronoi ipelet on Windows (issue #5).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.1.7 (2015-02-23)

 * Fifi shape and color now depends on the context: whether snapping
   to a vertex, boundary, the grid, etc.  When no snapping occurs,
   Fifi is not drawn at all.

 * The definition of B-splines has changed.  For reasons lost in the
   mist of time, Ipe has for many years used an incorrect definition
   of uniform B-splines, which handled the boundary conditions
   wrongly. In particular, the first and final segment of a spline was
   always a straight segment. 

   This has now been fixed, and the line/spline tools from now on
   create correct uniform B-splines.  In particular, splines with four
   control points are now identical to cubic Bezier segments.  As a
   generalization, a spline with three control points generates a
   quadratic Bezier segment, so the special keys 'q' and 'c' in the
   line tool are no longer needed.

   One benefit of this change is that it is now possible to cut
   B-splines (both open and closed) at any knot value, so that splines
   can be cut without first decomposing them entirely into Bezier
   curves. 

   Splines created with older versions of Ipe continue to work as
   before and can still be edited.  They are now called "old splines".

   As a result, the Ipe file format version was updated to 70107.
   Older versions of Ipe will not read files created with Ipe 7.1.7.

 * Separate snap mode for snapping to "control points".  These are the
   control points of splines, but also the centers of
   ellipses/circles/arcs, the corners of images, and the corners and
   reference point of text objects.

 * The midpoint of every straight segment is now also a snap point
   (when control point snapping is on).

 * When drawing a polyline or spline object, the previous segments of
   the object being drawn are now already magnetic and can be snapped
   to.  This feature was actually used in several snapping examples in
   the manual, but didn't work since Ipe 7.0.0.

 * A left double-click can now be used to terminate a path object
   instead of a right click.

 * Windows binaries now use a native UI without Qt.

 * On Windows, can now use two-finger touch gestures for pan and zoom.
   They work even in the middle of drawing an object with the mouse or
   the pen.

 * The paste actions (Ctrl+V) will now create an image object if the
   clipboard contains a bitmap (this function used to be "Insert image
   from clipboard").

 * When selecting objects by dragging a rectangle, select all objects
   included in the rectangle when dragging is from left to right,
   select all objects intersecting the rectangle when dragging is from
   right to left.

 * Windows shell no longer pops up when running Latex (feature #2).

 * Abort button for current drawing operation (useful on tablet
   computers without Escape key).

 * Focus now on text field in text creation dialogs.

 * When an external editor is defined, the dialog displaying the Latex
   error log now offers to show the Latex source used by Ipe (feature
   #24). 

 * Changed file extension of dynamic libraries to .dylib on Mac OS X
   (feature #20).

 * Charset support for Latex conversion now supported on Windows.

 * Static member function "selectPageOrView" moved from "PageSelector"
   to "CanvasBase".  "PageSelector" is now considered an internal
   class and should not be used by external code (it doesn't even
   exist in Windows code).

 * Developer menu with useful functions for customizing ipelets: reload
   all ipelets (this is useful when working on an ipelet), list all
   the keyboard shortcuts, check if there are any duplicate shortcuts
   defined.  The developer menu needs to be enabled by setting
   prefs.developer.

 * "Insert image" moved into Ipe program itself instead of an ipelet,
   now implemented using turbojpeg and libpng libraries instead of Qt.

 * Fixed creation of arc defined by three collinear points.

 * Lua bindings for: (1) getting gradient from a stylesheet; (2)
   creating gradients, tilings, and effects through an XML string; (3)
   removing definitions of symbolic names from a stylesheet.

 * In "Save as" file dialog, start with the current filename (feature
   #22). 

 * Fixed missed intersection points between splines and
   splines/segments (bug #8).

 * Unused arguments of Object::setAttribute removed.

 * Fixed crash when snapping to the intersection of two parallel lines
   (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=728479).

 * Changed default "Save as" destination on Windows to something more
   useful. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.1.6 (2014-12-05)

 * Fixed crash when input file contains zero-radius arc (bug #1).

 * Added missing "qhull.dll" (bug #3).

 * IPESTYLES and IPELETPATH now use semicolon as separator on Windows
   and colon on Unix (bug #4).

 * New arrow styles "ptarc" and "fptarc" for pointed arrows on
   circular arcs (feature #19).

 * Using a separate locale for number conversion, hopefully fixing the
   problems Ipe users on European locales with a comma for the decimal
   separator were having (bug #11).

 * Option "Pretty display" to avoid drawing the green bounding box for
   text objects, so that one can see what the drawing really looks
   like (feature #13).

 * Fixed snapping to negative grid coordinates (bug #9).

 * Preference prefs.editable_textfile to set the name of the text file
   to be written for editing in an external text editor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ipe 7.1.5 (2014-05-07)

 * Enabled automatic shortcuts on MacOS X.  The shortcuts Alt+Letter
   for menu items and dialog buttons should now also work on Macs
   (thanks Sascha).

 * Included Voronoi ipelet in Windows binaries

 * New -nocrop option in iperender.

 * prefs.editor_size setting now works in Qt build (bug #140).

 * prefs.docks to choose left/right dock side and prefs.hide_docks to
   select which docks should be visible when Ipe starts.

 * prefs.editor_closes_dialog to make editing dialog close immediately
   when user exits external editor

 * Fixed crash when Ipe file named on command line exists but cannot
   be loaded.

 * Fixed error message when trying to open PDF file that was not
   created by Ipe.

 * Iperender will now include the page background if used with
   -nocrop.

 * Fix compilation on MacOS X 10.9 (bug #145).

 * Del key on Mac keyboard now works to delete last vertex (bug
   #149).  

 * Bitmaps are now displayed on screen with better quality (thanks
   Dmitriy).

 * Link to IpePresenter in Ipe manual and on the webpage.
   IpePresenter executable included in Windows binary package.

 * Layer names with non-ASCII characters now work and no longer cause
   a crash (bugs #137 and #132).

 * Using libturbojpeg for decoding embedded JPEG images.  It's faster
   and fixes bug #125.

 * "Insert text box" now computes position of new textbox based on the
   position of the visible text only (feature #141).

 * When text size is changed, Latex is automatically run.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ipe 7.1.4 (2013-3-15) 

 * Windows binaries provided again.

 * Migrated to using Lua 5.2 (feature #113).

 * Fixed bug in "ipescript update-master" with several figures (bug
   #85).

 * Ipe scripts (to be run with "ipescript <script>") must no longer
   contain the 'require "ipe"' line.

 * Snap modes on Ipe-startup can now be specified in preferences
   (feature #122).

 * Work around rounding error in stretching code.

 * Improved Info.plist for Ipe application bundle on Mac OS X, to
   register Ipe as an editor for IPE, EPS, and PDF files (feature
   #90).

 * Selecting objects by dragging a rectangle now correctly updates the
   primary selection to the last newly selected object (bug #83).

 * Using Monospace font for coordinates, so they don't wobble anymore
   (bug #81).
 
 * Added grid-visible button to toolbar.

 * Support for scaling in coordinates display (feature #81).

 * Snap turned off when switching to "ink" mode if prefs.tablet_mode
   is true (feature #76).

 * Move layer to top didn't work correctly (bug #114).

 * Latex conversion did not work for old pdflatex versions without the
   \pdfobjcompresslevel macro (bug #116).

 * Added "Check layer from view" to layer menus (feature #115).

 * Deleting single view of a page disabled (bug #110).

 * No longer possible to delete all pages of a document from the page
   sorter (bug #111).

 * Fixed incorrect display of thumbnails in page/view selector and
   page sorter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ipe 7.1.2 (2012-1-16) SVN 580  Sydney edition

 * Latex is now automatically run every time text is inserted or

 * "Join paths" and "Compose paths" are again available in the
   properties menu (bug #91).

 * Invisible line segments with arrows now work correctly: If a line
   segment is set to "filled only", then the arrows are drawn in the
   fill color, and the segment itself is not drawn at all (bug #78).

 * Cycling through "stroke-only / stroke & fill / fill-only" no longer
   forgets the current colors of the object (bug #79).

 * "Delete" and "Merge" now show up for each layer, but give an error
   message if the layer is active.

 * Color icons again visible in stroke and fill color list in property
   menu. (Once again, Qt changed the semantics of an operation.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ipe 7.1.1 (2011-09-07) SVN 563 Oberwolfach edition

 * Fixed crash on odoc event on Mac OS X (bug #63).

 * When a point is created using the lines tool (by clicking left and
   then right at the same location), force line cap to be round to
   avoid making invisible object (and for consistency with ink tool).

 * IPESTYLES is now a list of style directories.  Ipe will search for
   stylesheets in all these directories. By default, this will now
   include ~/.ipe/styles on Unix, and also ~/Library/Ipe/Styles on
   OSX.

 * Fixed omission of ~/.ipe/ipelets on OSX and added
   ~/Library/Ipe/Ipelets as well.

 * Layers can now be moved in the layerlist (right-click on layer
   name).

 * Zoom and pan now properly initialized when Ipe starts up (feature
   #4).

 * New script "add-style" to add stylesheet to an Ipe figure.

 * New <textpad> setting in stylesheet to fix cropped text (bug #49).

 * Always present 'normal' as the first attribute in dropdown list.

 * Show real linewidth during handwriting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Ipe 7.1.0 (2011-08-29) SVN 549

 * Refactored Ipe code so that it is easy to build the Ipe application
   with different user interface toolkits.  A native Win32 interface
   is nearly complete.  A Gtk interface is being considered, with
   Canvas and dialog support implemented.  Perhaps someone will
   contribute a native Cocoa interface for Mac OS X.

 * Selection preserved after undo.

 * When adding objects to the selection, the last selected object is
   the primary selection.

 * New shredder mode (feature #16).

 * Easier customization of mouse buttons using a table in "mouse.lua".
   More than three buttons can now be used.  New "shred" operation.

 * Added "ipescript" tool.  It is no longer necessary to install the
   Ipe module for Lua to run scripts.

 * On MacOS X, the close button should now correctly reflect whether
   the document is modified.

 * Fixed display of subsection bookmarks (bug #31).

 * Fixed spurious loss of pinning information for group objects (bug #37).

 * First attempt to handle file-open events on Mac OS X.
   This would allow to launch documents by clicking them (feature #58).

 * Shortcut to rename the active layer (feature #50).

 * If prefs.tablet_mode is true, then in ink mode the selection is not
   highlighted and the cursor remains a dot (feature #26).

 * Error message when document requires charset conversion but iconv
   is not compiled in.

 * Fixed selection of invisible objects.

 * New dialog for jumping to a page or view, showing thumbnails of the
   pages/ views.
   This is implemented using a new widget and function in
   libipeqtcanvas so that it can be reused easily:
   int pno = ipeqt::PageSelector::selectPageOrView(doc)

 * When using the ink tool, actual stroke color is used while
   handwriting.

 * config.screen_geometry provides width and height of default screen
   in Lua.

 * New preference prefs.auto_external_editor.

 * Shortcuts in linetool can be configured (#346).

 * Fixed display of line cap and line join in EPS (bug #331).

 * Ipe should now work with Texlive 2010 (bug #350).

 * Fixed bug in undo clipping (bug #333).

 * Lua code can show and hide dock windows using showTool.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.10 (2009-12-09) SVN 402

 * Fixed crash in arc drawing (bug #324).
 
 * Allow customization of canvas display: paper color, classic grid,
   thickness of grid lines (see prefs.lua).

 * Fixed display in path drawing tool on Windows (bug #323).

 * Fixed broken line cap on circular arc (bug #325).

 * Preference to set size of main window at startup
   (prefs.window_size).

 * SONAME set for all dynamic libraries, and symbolic links created
   while building and installing.

 * The "change width" box was placed incorrectly if the minipage had
   been moved (bug #326).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.9 (2009-11-20) SVN 393

 * Changed default setting for MOC to moc-qt4.

 * IPEANCIENTPDFTEX environment variable to support pdftex versions
   older than 1.40.

 * Support for color-keyed bitmaps.

 * Fixed snapping to intersections of ellipses (bug #318).

 * Convert "runlatex.bat" to OEM codepage on Windows.

 * Open/Save can now handle non-ASCII filenames when not using UTF-8.

 * New script "ipe-update-master" (see manual under "advanced topics").

 * Better support for Mac OS 10.6 compilation.

 * Support non-ASCII characters in PDF output of document
   title/subject/author and in bookmarks.

 * config.platform now returns "apple" on Mac OS X.

 * Fixed snapping to boundaries of arcs.

 * Implemented F3 (Set line & snap) for arcs and Bezier splines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.8 (2009-11-04) SVN 373

 * Option -show-configuration to show the current configuration on
   stdout. 

 * Recognize Mac OS and change some compilation flags in Makefiles.
 
 * FreeBSD and Mac OS do not support "install -t <dir>", and so
   invocations of "install" were changed to use the traditional syntax
   "install <files> <dir>".

 * Fixed wrong transformation matrix after path editing (bug #313).

 * New preference to set size of dialog to create/edit text objects.

 * Fixed crash during stylesheet add (bug #315). 

 * New shortcut "Ctrl+Return" to accept dialogs (useful in multi-line
   text input fields).

 * Enabled display of paper boundary during panning again.

 * Menu item for showing/hiding bookmarks.

 * Tooltips in "Properties" dock.
 
 * "Edit" button in stylesheets dialog to edit stylesheet using
   external editor.

 * Fixed mouse shortcuts (Shift+Right and Shift+Ctrl+Right didn't work
   properly).

 * Moved path join/cap/fill rule to the path property menu.

 * Added opacity and gradient pattern to path property menu.

 * Current settings indicated in path property menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.7 (2009-10-23) SVN 361

 * Removed -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti from CXXFLAGS, to avoid
   surprises like bug #308.

 * Fixed broken interpretation of symbol/mark matrix (bug #310).

 * Fixed page numbering (bug #311).

 * Implemented "prefs.select_distance".

 * Fixed incorrect handling of line cap and line join (bug #312).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.6 (2009-10-23) SVN 359

 * Worked around Qt styling bug in QComboBox (bug #308).  Using
   QSignalMapper now to map signals (no derived classes).

 * LayerBox popup moved into Lua code.

 * Fixed renaming of active layers.

 * Fixed selection of objects in locked layers.

 * Function to check symbolic attributes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.5 (2009-10-22) SVN 357

 * Created script "svgtoipe.py" to convert SVG files to Ipe format.
   It is available as a separate download.

 * Made Lua interface for attribute values more robust - interface now
   checks that attributes have correct type before passing them to
   Ipelib.  This fixes opacity names starting with digits. (Bug #288)

 * #define to enable use of ancient pdftex versions ( < 130).
   Bug #309.

 * Show current view and page number in the properties window.

 * Environment variable IPEQTSTYLE sets this Qt style.  Saying, for
   instance, 'export IPEQTSTYLE="cleanlooks" ' would fix the Qt crash
   in some styles on some systems. (See bug #308.)

 * Gradient support changed: gradients are now used as fill patterns
   for path objects.  Gradients can now have more than two color
   stops.
   The file format has changed slightly because of this, so the
   current file format version is 70005.   There is no support for
   reading 70000-version files with gradients.

 * Support base64-encoding for bitmaps in XML format.

 * Fixed views without active layer.

 * Fixed filename in autosave (bug #2883631).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.4 (2009-10-14) SVN 335

 * Fixed bug in save_as (bug #305).

 * ipe6upgrade: fixed empty dash.
 
 * Fixed handling of matrix in path join.

 * Added "arc" and "farc" arrow types.  When the final segment of a
   path is circular arc, then these arrows take on a shape that
   depends on the radius of the arc, as metafont arrows do.

 * Fixed handling of path objects with missing stroke and fill
   attributes. 

 * Added "presentation.isy" to styles directory.  You can now create a
   new presentation by saying "ipe -sheet presentation".

 * Fixed computation of bounding box of transformed text object.

 * Fixed handling of horizontal and vertical alignment and
   transformable text from Properties menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.3 (2009-10-10) SVN 318

 * Style sheets now looked for in IPESTYLES directory, so it suffices
   to say "ipe -sheet presentation" to create a new presentations.

 * Fixed cropped boundaries in iperender (bug #284).

 * "Save as" dialog will start in more sensible directory (can be
   customized, see prefs.save_as_directory).

 * Using Cairo font if Latex has not been run.

 * Fixed colorstack problem in Latex run, require Pdflatex 1.30.

 * Ipe can now create independent bounding boxes for each view.
   This is activated by creating a layer named "VIEWBBOX".

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.2 (2009-09-27) SVN 311

 * Path edit tool, including scissors and path join implemented.

 * Implemented clipping path operations for groups.

 * Several bugs fixed.

 * Implemented automatic angular snapping.

 * Included intersection snapping (from pre29).

 * Fixed Cairo glyph cache handling (bug #293).

 * Fixed snapping to ends of B-spline (bug #290).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.1 (2009-09-17) SVN 288

 * Path entry tool finished, can switch between spline and line mode
   and handle quadratic and cubic Bezier splines and circular arcs.

 * If Ipe is called with a non-existing file as an argument, it will
   not show an error message but remember the file for the next save.

 * Mark shape selection moved to properties window.

 * Added $(INSTALL_ROOT) variable to Makefiles for packaging.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 7.0.0 (2009-09-16) SVN 282
 
 * Most of Ipe was rewritten entirely.

 * Group object can now have a clipping path.

 * User-defined marks and arrows can be defined in a style sheet.

 * Gradients, tilings, and transparency added.

 * Standard style settings are no longer hardwired into Ipe. 
   Everything is defined in loadable stylesheets.

 * Mouse button shortcuts have been changed.  Right mouse button is
   now always the popup menu. 

 * Using Cairo library for rendering Ipe documents, Qt for the user
   interface, and Lua as a scripting language.  The entire high-level
   Ipe model is written in Lua.

 * Namespaces ipe, ipeqt, ipeui, ipelua.

 * C++ method names now start with a lowercase letter.

 * Mark object removed (it is now implemented using symbols).

 * Ipeextract can open any Ipe file (any version of Ipe 6 or 7) and
   extract the XML stream. Ipeextract can help to recover files that
   are unreadable due to an Ipe bug.

 * There were many small changes in the file format during the
   lifetime of Ipe 6, and it was becoming cumbersome (and buggy) to
   keep Ipe able to read all these various versions.  Ipe 7.0 has a
   fresh format, and a separate program ipe6upgrade is used to convert
   from Ipe 6 to Ipe 7 format.

 * The grid has been replaced by graph paper.

 * Ipetopng was replaced by iperender, which can produce output in PNG
   and in SVG.  SVG output can be used to embed scalable Ipe figures
   in webpages.  Iperender does not need to be linked with a GUI
   toolkit and requires no X server, so it can easily be used on a
   webserver (to convert Latex source to images or SVG art).

 * Ipe now fails gracefully on incorrect XML input.

 * Painter now has a drawArc primitive.  Circular arcs on the screen
   should now be accurate even at high zoom. (PDF and Postscript
   output still needs to approximate using splines, though.)

 * Text "transformable" attribute replaced by general
   "transformations" attribute. Any object can be restricted to
   translations only or rigid motions only.

 * Ipe now runs creates temporary directory for running latex under
   Windows in user's local APPDATA directory.

 * Ipe XML format contains DOCTYPE declaration, and "ipe.dtd" is
   provided. 

 * Ipetoipe, ipe6upgrade, ipeextract guess output filename if it is
   not provided.

 * Appearance of page numbers on the page can be customized in the
   style sheet.

 * Text for latex conversion is now written out in UTF-8, and it is
   assumed that Pdflatex can handle that (using a suitable package,
   either "inputenc" or "CJK").

 * Ipe symbols can be used as the "bullet" in itemize environments etc.

 * Path objects can be drawn using a pen on a tablet PC.

 * New alignment modes to distribute centers and sides equally.

 * Latex and XML code can now be edited using an external editor.

 * Support for subpixel information from a tablet (but still
   completely untested).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 32 patch 1 (2009-04-30)

 * Fixed writing floating point numbers again (bug #279).

 * Qt 4.5 breaks setting locale (bug #281).

 * Fixed broken \rule (bug #268).

 * Removed check against freetype version.  It breaks Ipe whenever
   distributions upgrade freetype, and seems no longer necessary.  In
   principle, freetype should provide upwards binary compatibility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 32 (2008-12-01)

 * Fixed writing floating point numbers (bug #274).

 * Fixed compilation with Qt 4.2 (bug #272).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 31 (2008-11-04)

 * Fixed display of mathematical symbols and rules (bugs #253, #268).

 * ANSI C now requires printf to obey the locale.  Since the Ipe file
   format must be locale independent, we just set the numeric locale
   to "C" until it becomes clear how ANSI C wants programs to write
   locale independent data files (bug #263).

 * Ipe now tries hard not to write numbers in the "1e-3" format that
   PDF and Postscript do not understand (bug #209).

 * Correctly handle & in page titles and section headings (bug #240).

 * Fixed incorrect label for "Turn 90 degrees" and "Turn 270 degrees"
   ipelets (bug #244).

 * Some changes for g++ 4.3 (bug #265).

 * Ipe5toxml now distributed separately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 30 (2007-11-27)

 * Ipe now works with pdftex 1.40 (in MikTeX 2.6 and texlive 2007).

 * Pascal-Nicolas Becker, Frederik Hermans, and Damian Schmidt
   implemented the missing forms of intersection snapping (for arcs
   and Bezier curves), with bug fix by Jonathan Backer.

 * Fixed the broken user interface (fields were too small to contain
   the text) on Unix (removed a static QFont) (bug #191).

 * Figtoipe now distributed separately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 28 (2006-12-23)

 * To allow for interesting styles that can be applied at will and
   exchanged to change the look of a presentation, there were several
   changes. The "layout" now defines the size of the paper and the
   'frame', a rectangular area where (most) drawing on a page will
   occur. The origin of the Ipe coordinate system is the lower left
   corner of the frame (no longer of the paper).  The frame can be
   anywhere on the paper, and is displayed with a dotted line on the
   screen.  The layout is specified in the style sheet (and so the
   paper size can no longer be changed from the UI).

 * Antialiasing now also works on systems without X Render extension.

 * Pages can now have a title (Page/Edit title and sections).  If a 
   title is set, it is displayed on the page as defined in the style
   sheet. 

 * Objects can now be pinned horizontally, vertically, or entirely.

 * Ipe no longer makes a distinction between 'textbox' and
   'minipage'.  The function "Insert textbox" actually inserts a
   'minipage', set to cover the entire width of the frame and
   horizontally pinned, with transformable set to false.

 * Textstretch is now a single scalar.

 * Snapping now recognizes the corners and the boundary of paper and
   frame.

 * New alignment functions: left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and
   left-and-right, top-and-bottom.

 * New "Properties" menu, where the properties not in the properties
   panel can be set and changed (en masse).  Mark shape and
   transformable text have been moved here.

 * The layout of the properties panel can now be selected from three
   variants (one row, one column, and two columns as before).

 * Added "Change text width" to "Edit" menu (and a shortcut key).

 * Coordinate display shows units.

 * Automatic angular snap is now in force during moving.

 * Ipe now requires Qt 4.2 or higher (Qmake has silently changed its
   quoting syntax) (bug #176).

 * Moved layer renaming to layer list and fixed problem (bug #187).

 * New functions for moving to/selecting all in any layer.

 * Added -from and -to options to ipetoipe.

 * Fixed display of bitmaps in Background template in PDF output.

 * Fixed crash when a style sheet containing a template was updated.

 * Fixed paste-undo-undo crash (bug #198).
 
 * Ipetopng no longer needs an X server.

 * Hopefully fixed the bug that caused keyboard shortcuts to not work
   sometimes.  

 * Save and restore toolbar state (bug #197).

 * When the page is empty, "Fit objects" does a "Fit frame".

 * Removed canvas tooltip again.  It was too annoying.

 * Added "Move" ipelet by Gunter Schenck to distribution (bug #53).

 * Added "Euclidean Geometry" ipelet by Jari Lappalainen to
   distribution. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 27 (2006-09-26)

 * Function to update all style sheets of the document from external
   style sheet files (with matching names in the same directory as the
   Ipe document). 

 * Mark objects can now be filled (for type 'Box' and 'Circle') (bug
   #139).

 * Text style now accessible through popup menu.

 * Text size can now be set while creating text object.

 * Option -styleupdate for "ipetoipe".

 * New functions to move objects forward/backward more precisely (bug #144).

 * Can now select display of mouse position in points, inches, or
   millimeters (bug #156).

 * Removed the inclusion of additional directories to the Latex source
   path. It didn't work in a portable way, and I don't think it's very
   useful.  Fixes problems with MikTex 2.5 (bug #179).

 * Double buffering is now a preference.  It seems not to work on some
   (Linux) systems.

 * Disable canvas tooltip while drawing.

 * Text in Background template works now.

 * Fixed double vertex in regular k-gon.

 * Ipetoipe showed number of pages, not number of views, when testing
   for conversion to EPS (bug #155).

 * Fixed display of size (not an integer) in ipetopng (bug #155).

 * Fixed warning when compiling ipestdfonts with GCC 4.2 (bug #159).

 * Fixed inclusion of JPG images with zero resolution.

 * Last line in minipage environments is terminated with a LF now.

 * Save as bitmap now uses anti-aliasing (bug #138).
 
 * Fixed warnings on unused return values (bug #169, #170).

 * Changed project type of ipelets to plugin (bug #171).

 * Fixed rendering bug for text (bug #146).

 * Added "Reset Direction" function (bug #140).

 * Fixed crash when path started with zero length segment followed by
   circle arc (bug #145).

 * Reading and writing through Qt is now explicitely buffered (bug
   #162).

 * Fixed duplicated control point when joining paths to form a closed
   loop (bug #133).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 26 (2005-12-14)

 * Added visibility polygon ipelet by Chris Gray.

 * Anti-aliasing enabled for lines and edges (this is controlled by
   the preference setting for anti-aliasing fonts).  Enabled
   double-buffering.

 * Changed how key assignments are defined.  Key assignments can be
   easily customized by editing an XML file.  Keyboard shortcuts can
   be defined for any Ipelet as well.
   
 * Changed "default" text style back to Latex default style (justified).

 * Fixed matrix problem in smallest-circle ipelet.

 * Fixed "pan here" (bug #119).

 * Fixed cancellation of color dialog (bug #121).

 * Added "About ipelets" to display proper credits for code used in
   ipelets. 

 * Virtual destructors to make g++ 4 happy.

 * Changed rendering of text (using QPainter::drawImage).

 * Fixed bug #122 (shortcuts for actions were not disabled during
   drawing). 

 * Fixed bug #123 (Fifi bleeding).

 * Fixed default setting of editor font (bug #131).
 
 * Fixed problem in JPEG importing on systems where char is signed.

 * Starting to make snapshots available between releases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 25 (2005-11-24)

 * Migrated to Qt 4.0.0 and switched to MinGW compiler on Windows.

 * Added smallest enclosing circle ipelet written by Chris Gray to the
   distribution.

 * Removed the 'Postscript' file format.  The three Ipe file formats
   are now XML, PDF, and EPS.

 * 'void' is no longer allowed as a stroke color.  To draw objects
   without boundary, use the new 'void' line style.  This model allows
   for arrows without tails, and avoids problems with invisible text
   and marks.

 * If the style sheet contains a template with name "Background", this
   template will automatically be shown on each page.  There is no
   need to explicitely create a reference on each page anymore. 
   This replaces the old "background" layer + reference mechanism.

 * Templates containing bitmaps are now supported (bug #100).

 * Minipage objects now have a "Latex style" - common Latex
   environments can be used that way without having to type them every
   time.

 * When Ipe displays the Latex log file, it highlights the errors and
   scrolls automatically to the first one.

 * Ipe can now number pages visibly in the PDF output.

 * Resolution of bitmaps displayed on screen now configurable.

 * Default line cap, line join, and fill rule can now be defined in
   the style sheet.  Object menu now shows them
   correctly (enhancement #79).

 * Ipe XML files can now have extension ".ipe" (enhancement #92).

 * Changes to stroke color of text objects are displayed immediately. 

 * Option -runlatex for Ipetoipe (enhancement #88).

 * Loading and saving alternative formats replaced by auto-exporting.

 * Ipe XML parser now silently skips all tags whose name starts with
   "x-". This allows you to make XML files with more information, to
   be shared between other programs and Ipe (enhancement #110).

 * -nocolor option for ipetoipe (enhancement #107).

 * 'media' attribute is now in the <info> element, where it should have
   been all along.

 * Fixed building RPM from source RPM (bug #98, thanks to Laurent
   Rineau).

 * Fixed -lastview option in ipetoipe (introduced in pre23 but didn't
   actually work...)

 * No more support for KDE (it doesn't use Qt 4).

 * Fixed bug #86 (incorrect XML for textsize).

 * Fixed bug #116 (error in IpeBezier::Straight).

 * XML comments now use correct syntax <!-- ... --> .

 * "Ipe5toxml" is no longer automatically called.

 * Fixed bug #103 (comment in last line of text object).

 * Recognize alternative names of standard fonts used in libwmf (bug
   #109).

 * Fixed bug #77 (spaces in layer names).
 
 * Fixed bug #83 (editing a path lost arrows).

 * Fixed bug #102 (bookmark destinations were wrong).

 * Fixed bug #96 (vertical text caused Acrobat to fail opening PDF).

 * Removed handling of obsolete Ipe file versions in IpeImlParser.

 * A subpath consisting of a single moveto no longer causes Ipe to
   crash (but to fail an assertion).

 * Fixed bug #74 (New layer, new view keeps view settings).

 * "Last page" now goes to last page (not second-to-last one).

 * Snapping to center of arc works now.
 
 * Changed computation of dimmed colors (Qt's definition doesn't dim
   black at all).

 * Intersection snapping now works inside groups.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 23 (2004-11-22)

 * Option for ipetoipe to save last view of each page only (#69).

 * Fixed bug #70 (wrong filename for ipe5toxml)

 * Fixed bug #71 (compiler warning in qvoronoi.cpp)

 * Fixed ASCII85 encoder (if # bytes was multiple of 4, no EOD marker
   was generated).  Caused errors in Ghostscript, as reported by Jirka
   Matousek. 

 * Bug #72 appears to be fixed.

 * Fixed bug #67 (splinegons with less than 3 control points).

 * Fixed bug #65 (changing attributes and visibility of layers does
   not cause "edited" status of page to be changed).

 * Added "figtoipe", an auxiliary program that converts figures in FIG
   format (as created by xfig) to Ipe format.

 * Fixed filename of "ipe5toxml" in Unix build.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 22 (2004-09-07)

 * Fixed crash when cutting the only page.

 * Fixed handling of mark size, text size and mark shape in group
   objects. 

 * Fixed bug #59: pasting didn't work on Unix.

 * Fixed bug #64: undo wasn't properly cleared.

 * Fixed bug #58: "Edit object" now in Edit menu.

 * Fixed enabling/disabling of keyboard shortcuts for edit menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 21

 * Fixed compilation on some Debian architectures.

 * Corrected default location of manpages (.../share/man/man1)

 * Saving page labels in PDF file.

 * Revised handling of shortcut keys completely.  Shortcuts should now
   be recognized in any situation.

 * Fixed bug #54: Selecting objects no longer first snaps the cursor
   position.

 * Fixed bug #55: Edit path didn't show your options when started.

 * Don't create CropBox/ArtBox for entirely empty pages (crashes
   gpdf).

 * Added sections and subsections for multi-page documents (shown as
   "Bookmarks" in PDF readers).

 * Documented environment variables in man pages and manual.

 * Members of IpeView are now private.

 * Added -noshading option to ipetoipe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 20
 
 * It now works to copy objects between Ipe and Emacs on Unix as
   well. 

 * Added <cmap> tag to style sheet.

 * Fixed behavior of "stretch" on aligned mouse movements (also fixes
   bug #49).

 * Fixed crash in "Fit objects" when width or height is zero.

 * Fixed Postscript rendering of objects where stroke and fill color
   are identical (and not black).

 * Fixed rounding behavior of resolution when zooming in and out.

 * Fixed deletion of layer.

 * Removed hiding of layers.  The difference between a hidden layer
   and a layer not in the current view was too confusing.

 * Page tools hidden when only one view exists.

 * Fixed rendering of selection on Unix.

 * Fixed oversized color tools.

 * Made grid size an integer.

 * Showing relative coordinates as well as absolute ones.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 19 (2004-06-30)

 * Fixed crash in scissors.

 * Removed IPEDATADIR from options.

 * Moved documentation to /usr/share/doc in RPMs.

 * Generate /ToUnicode character maps if Cyberbit is used. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 18 (2004-06-28)

 * Fixed crash when creating circle through three points.

 * Compilation against KDE libraries supported.  This only adds very
   rudimentary KDE support, for instance Ipe now correctly switches
   style when the theme is changed in the KDE control center.

 * All personal Ipe configuration files are now in $HOME/.ipe

 * Added -debug command line flag.

 * Building source RPM and binary RPM for Fedora Core 2. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 17 (2004-06-25)

 * Added man pages.

 * Fixed incorrect call to putenv (glibc has changed the semantics).

 * Removed dependence on Xpdf. Ipelib now contains the necessary code
   to parse and produce PDF as well as Postscript, so Ipelib clients
   can open any kind of Ipe document.

 * Removed pdftoipe from main Ipe distribution and packaged separately
   (it's still contained in the Windows distribution).

 * Fixed enormous memory leak in Ipebitmap destructor.

 * Directory for documentation is now configurable separately (for
   systems such as Debian where the natural place for documentation is
   in /usr/share/doc/ipe).

 * Ipe now displays current mouse position in user coordinates.

 * Split ipetoipe and ipetopng.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 16 (2004-06-05)

 * Ipetoipe was not installed.

 * Ipe could not load its own figures because of a stupid typo.

 * Fixed a bug in scissors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 15 (2004-06-04)

 * Color changes in text objects (e.g. made using \textcolor) and
   quotient bars are now shown on screen.

 * Views (that is, page views) are now fully integrated in Ipe's main
   user interface. They are easier to create and maintain.

 * Views keep a record of the active layer, so that switching back to
   a view to edit it makes objects go in the right layer (usually).

 * Pressing the right mouse button in the layer list opens a context
   menu.

 * Changed handling of style-sheet stretching of text objects.  The
   width/depth/height of text objects now correctly reflects this
   stretching, and when creating a minipage object, the user drags out
   the actual desired width.  

   Unfortunately, this changes the semantics of Ipe documents!  To
   make it possible to do this change automatically, the style sheet
   tag has been renamed from <textmatrix> to <textstretch> (with
   slightly changed syntax, see the manual).  Currently, a simple
   automatic conversion is done: if the style sheet contains ANY
   textmatrix tag, the conversion factor is applied to the width of
   ALL text objects in the document.

 * Simple background shadings are now possible using <shading> in a
   style sheet.

 * Two new types of text objects defined.  They are just variants of
   label and minipage.  A new function 'Insert text object' creates
   textbox objects with fixed left and right margins (set in the style
   sheet).

 * Move-to-back function now inserts in front of anything in
   background layer.

 * Renamed the method NotifyStyle to CheckStyle.  

 * Added a simple clipping ipelet (clips only marks and line segments
   to a convex polygon - just about enough to be useful for clipping
   Voronoi diagrams).

 * Fixed bug #42 (linewidth could be null in IpeBBoxPainter).

 * Ipe remembers file format used for saving. 

 * Latex style files are now searched for both in the current
   directory and in the directory containing the Ipe document.

 * Command line option -geom WxH+X+Y (note the slight difference to
   X11, where the option is '-geometry').  Smarter zoom on opening
   documents. 

 * Simplified handling of locked layers.  A locked layer cannot be
   made the active layer now.

 * Each page stores the grid size used to create it.

 * Only one (global) media size per Ipe document.

 * Refactored Ipe program into separate model/canvas library.  
   The Ipe canvas can be reused by programs wishing to display Ipe
   data. 

 * Ipe file format conversion functionality (-topng, -topdf etc) has
   been moved into a separate program "ipetoipe".

--------------------------------------------------------------------

   with MikTeX 2.4.

 * Documentation wasn't installed correctly.

 * According to Stefan Langerman, Mac OS X 10.3 changes name
   convention for dynamic libraries.  Fixed in Ipe.

 * Fixed bug #18. The directory containing the Ipe file is now
   searched for Latex style files. (When using the -topdf etc options,
   the current directory is searched.)

 * Fixed bug #20, creation of arc/circle through three collinear
   points.

 * Added feature #22 (loading and modifying files for which pdf and
   eps versions exist).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 11 (2003-11-06)

   command line as -topng).

 * Fixed behaviour when switching between absolute and symbolic
   attributes. Introduced separate switch for grid size and angle.

 * Fixed masks for toolbar icons.

 * Zlib no longer included in source distribution, upgraded to zlib
   1.1.4 in Windows distribution.

 * Text objects have no snapping.

 * Inserting JPEG images is now supported.

 * Inserting bitmap images compresses the bitmap (makes PDF, EPS, and
   XML files smaller).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 6.0 preview 4 (2003-02-28)

 * First public release of Ipe 6.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 5.0 August 15, 1994

 * rewrote Ipe to run under the X window system, and ported to 
   HP7xx systems and Sun SparcStations.

 * the user interface is now based on Motif.

 * there are two versions of the canvas, one using gl and my
   previous code, the other using plain X calls. This version,
   however, needs to allocate a large number of color cells to
   implement an overlay plane with double buffering (which gives much
   smoother drawing).

 * added fields showing the name of the last operation and the
   keyboard shortcut.

 * the Ium interface now handles -input and -file, and is capable of
   making this persistent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 4.1 July 5, 1994

 * fixed bugs introduced with the transition to PLAGEO 2.0.

 * changed calling of Iums so that the same Ipe binary works under
   irix 4.0.5 and irix 5.x.

 * the windows are now redrawn while loading and saving files.

 * moved more complicated Iums out of standard Ipe distribution and
   put the documentation on my www page (the world wide Ipe home
   page), instead of in the Ipe documentation. This will make it
   easier and more convenient to update the set of Iums for non-local
   users.

 * the executable for a Ium is now required to have the file extension
   .ium.

 * the height of the bounding box shown for minipages is now computed
   through LaTeX. Only the width is part of the minipage's definition.

 * added Segments object type, to compactify Ipe files containing lots
   of strokes of the same type (which typically arise in mechanically
   created drawings).

 * fixed up manual and index.

 * added blueadj and display options for mipe.cls.

 * changed style files and documentation to conform to LaTeX2e.

 * font sizes are now defined as floats, so we can use real LaTeX font sizes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Ipe 4.0 March 8, 1994

 * the Ipe file format is now at the same time an encapsulated
   Postscript file (eps), and it can be included without any package
   support. The style file ipe.sty is now only necessary for
   scaling or other non-standard behavior.

 * Text and Mark objects can now be invisible, like any other
   object.

 * when creating a Minipage object, you first have to drag out a
   bounding rectangle.

 * when previewing a single page that does not contain any text
   object, Latex is not run anymore.

 * introduced UndoLimit configuration variable and statistics function
   (in misc menu).

 * fixed treatment of linewidth for Postscript importing.

 * made changes necessary to use PLAGEO 2.0.

 * while loading a file, the new Latex preamble is now already in
   effect. But: this is now also true when inserting a file.  After
   insertion, the preamble of the containing file is used again.  This
   may become confusing.

 * the center of the drawing is now mapped to (300bp,400bp), so that
   printing the Ipe file directly will roughly center it on a4 or
   letter style paper.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 3.2 February 10, 1994

 * made Ipe into a ``package'' (this concerns some changes in
   our local installation.)

 * the manual is now in a reasonable shape

 * added ``Ipe user objects'', the possibility to specify an
   Ipe file as a ``user macro''.

 * added "With Prologue" button and code.

 * added arrows for splines (back). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 3.1 February 1, 1994

 * rewrote the spline code. Ipe now has a full spline object
   type, supports snapping to splines, and has a clearer interface.

 * the pop up bit-planes are now managed via redraw events. The
   interface is much clearer. Made colors that are used in pop up
   planes user-definable.

 * added directional snapping modes.

 * made mouse-explainer work for forms objects and with Shift and Ctrl
   keys.

 * put documentation in html document.

 * added some Ipe user macros for handling bitmaps, based on the "lug"
   graphics utilities library by Raul Rivero.

 * changed handling for calling Iums. Ipe will now redraw while
   waiting for a Ium to finish, and the ESC button can be used to
   cancel a Ium.

 * added a Ium for polygon approximation.

 * added reading and writing of raw bitmaps when communicating with
   Iums.

 * added a contour tracer for the Bitmap Ipe user macro.

 * added MakeBackups option.

 * when Ipe is killed and the drawing is not saved, Ipe will now
   save it in #unsaved.ipe#.

 * added Iums to call imged, imgworks, and xpaint.

 * "preview page" and "preview all" now use different temporary files,
   so they will not collide any more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 3.0 January 1, 1994

 * fixed bug in Postscript prologue that made coexistence of ipe.sty and
   epsf.sty in same LaTeX-file difficult

 * Now Ipe does not crash anymore when the Ghostscript window is
   deleted from the window manager. The next time that preview is
   called, a new Ghostscript window is created.

 * revised the handling of keyboard and menu events. They are now
   table-driven, and controlled by a single subroutine.

 * reintroduced the Zoom & Pan mode for synchronizing the Ghostscript
   window. It is much more convenient than the fully dynamic mode.

 * added a documented .iperc file format. Ipe will no longer start up
   without such a configuration file (but you can specify a different
   one using the -n flag).

 * Line widths, font sizes, grid sizes and the like are now all
   defined in the configuration file. There is no new line style
   function anymore, and no save configuration option.  All counters
   are replaced by choice objects.

 * added type-driven selection mode. If the Ctrl key is pressed when
   selecting objects with the right mouse button, only objects of the
   currently active type are considered. The same works for M-C-a.

 * added interface to Ipe user macros, and moved several rarely used
   functions and the import functions into Iums.

 * export Idraw has disappeared for the time being. I have never
   actually used this feature yet, and it's a mess, since all
   interesting pictures have some elements that Idraw doesn't
   understand.

 * wrote several pretty simple Iums based on existing plageo or leda
   code. Currently available are convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, and
   clipping of polygonal objects.

 * revised the snapping concept, introduced priorities, and made
   peaceful coexistence of angular and boundary snapping possible.

 * Rotate, Scale, and Stretch are now available using a modifier key
   and the mouse. Their buttons have disappeared, since these
   operations are not actually object types, and there should not be
   such an ``object type.''

 * added delete function, that deletes objects without placing them in
   the cut buffer.

 * added keys C-d and r for the polygonal objects edit mode, and key
   C-d for line entry.

 * there is now a panning function. This was necessary because of the
   multi-page mode, were the template has to remain aligned with
   respect to all pages.

 * the snap to intersection point function now recognizes self
   intersections of polygonal chains. Also added a button to control
   snapping to object itself during editing and entry of polygonal
   objects.

 * added Fifi, a little marker that accompanies the cursor and shows
   the current snapping.

 * Ipe now does not crash anymore when the background Latex process
   for finding bounding boxes wants to read another file.

 * added bitmap object type, and a Ium to read in Silicon Graphics
   .rgb format files as bitmaps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.4 December 3, 1993

 * fixed bug in text yank that made Ipe crash

 * added multi-page mode

 * when undo is turned off in the configuration panel, the storage
   currently used by the undo buffer is released

 * the saved properties now do not contain a description of the data.
   If you use the edit properties function, you are supposed to know
   what you are doing.

 * changed keyboard shortcuts to cohere to IES (International Emacs
   Standard)

 * changed layout of configuration form to fit better with main form

 * added configuration option to disable drawing of filled
   splines. This is much faster than the default behavior.

 * Zoom now has a logarithmic scale, and different interface.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.3 August 11, 1993

 * scale and rotate now use center of object by default.

 * fixed bug in precise scale

 * added second input mode for arcs, using center of circle

 * added arrows on arcs

 * made Latex preamble for previewing and printing user-definable

 * bounding box for text objects is now computed by Latex

 * fixed two severe bugs that caused Ipe to eat up memory

 * put help information into a Texinfo file

 * made Control-middle button shortcut for scale/stretch

 * added Ghostscript previewer that runs in background

 * added importing Postscript files

 * changed all fixed limits to rerays, to make sure that arbitrary
   Postscript files that can be read won't make Ipe crash

 * allow filled non-simple polygons

 * added snapping to intersection points

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.2 August 1, 1993

 * added circular arc object type

 * added minipage version of text objects

 * added support for splines.

 * circles now behave properly when stretched and become ellipses

 * more color buttons, click with left and right mouse for fill and
   stroke

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.1 July 28, 1993

 * snapping to other objects

 * viewing and editing object properties

 * parameter form to change the configuration

 * changed layout of form

 * added icons for object type buttons

 * added field showing arrow/line style choice

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ipe 2.0 July 14, 1993

 * This is the first version of Ipe. It is version 2.0 to distinguish
   the Ipe file format from the format generated by "ipefy".

--------------------------------------------------------------------
